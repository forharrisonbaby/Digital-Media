                <h3><span>AI project</span></h3>
                <p>For our AI project, we had to generate an image of something at school 
                    (I choose the school bathroom tiles) Then, we had to make a Cosmic
                    using the AI image that we generated. On a whim, I came up with this idea of 
                    a burglerer breaking into a wall and stealing and apple and fighting the 
                    superhero apple man. The creepy face in the wall is supposed to be that 
                    burglerer. I then thought that it actually had to only be based on the 
                    orginal generated image, so it wasn't used in the final comic.  </p>
                    <h3><span>Artist Statement</span></h3>
                <p> I think I was pretty successful in recreating my work. The only problem was that I just couldn’t make the AI make all of the tiles the same shape and less vibrant. But overall, I think I captured its essence. 
                    My story is simply that an apple thief stole apple man’s apple, so apple man got it back. The story is the most important aspect to any piece of art; its message.
                    I've found that the more complicated your prompt is, the less accurate the final result is. All that matters is your vision, and how much effort you put into each individual prompt. AI art would be a pretty boring replacement for classwork. It's basically like telling a master artist what to draw and taking the credit for the outcome. We’d learn nothing. I do believe that AI will come so close to replicating Human creativity that it’ll be impossible for any of us to tell it apart from a real Human. So on the outside, it’ll be amazing at replacing Human creativity.

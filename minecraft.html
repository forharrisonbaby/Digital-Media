                <h3><span>Minecraft Project</span></h3>
                <p> We never really had a designated "minecraft project". At some point we had to 
                    pick a company to create marketing for, and I chose the company behind 
                    minecraft. I made a youtube thumbnail showing how friendly pillagers are,
                    and finally a moodboard that showcases minecraft's adventurous feel. Overall,
                    I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. </p>
                <h3><span>Artist Statement</span></h3>
                <p> I’m pretty sure this was my favorite project yet. First off, let's start off with the 
                    mood board. Most of my images are cinematic texture packed versions of minecraft, to make it 
                    feel more authentic. I also included my textured image around the title 
                    of the whole thing, “Minecraft”. In the background, the gutters are made 
                    of the nether dimension, showing how the game can switch from peaceful to hardcore in a heartbeat.
                    I also have the words “A world where anything is possible”, which I’m pretty sure 
                    came from the trailer of the game. I also have a color palette consisting of green, 
                    brown, grey, and blue, symbolizing green, dirt, stone and water. Alright, let's mention 
                    the thumbnail. It's Mr Zeng being robbed by pillagers. I also included the official minecraft
                    title card, because I got inspired by some nostalgic minecraft 
                    thumbnails that I researched. The fact that we were able to 
                    choose essentially whatever we wanted made me have a blast with 
                    his project, so yay.

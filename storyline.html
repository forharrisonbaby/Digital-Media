                <h3><span>Storyline Project</span></h3>
                <p> For this project, we had to take a series of photos in order to 
                    flesh out a unique story. However, we had to use a variety of 
                    photography techniques such as leading lines, rule of 3rds, and framing
                    we decided to make a story about a librarians typical day. They'd bring books to the
                    library, and stay in their outpost as the library slowly got more and more chaotic.
                 </p>
                 <h3><span>Artist Statement</span></h3>
                <p> Our project was made to put the viewer’s eyes through the lens of our school 
                    librarian , Ms.Mendlowits’ everyday life. Our librarian opens the door to the
                    library, and we decided to use straight vertical lines to emphasize the 
                    simplicity. Our second picture shows a scene where Ms.Mendlowitz brings her
                    books in for the day to read and we decided to use rule of thirds to
                    emphasize the librarian. Similar to our second picture, our third shows 
                    the daily tasks of the librarian everyday, so we decided to use horizontal
                    straight lines to add to the simplicity. The fourth picture is meant to 
                    show how the bookshelves look after the librarian does her work and we used 
                    framing to add emphasis on the books. Our 5th picture represents the library 
                    as the day passes. People begin to accumulate during lunch and it begins to 
                    get crowded. We also used the rule of thirds to emphasize the groups of 
                    people who come during lunch. Our last picture is supposed to represent the 
                    library during the 9th period. We decided that emphasizing shudder was a fair
                    way to represent the flocks of people since we wanted to put emphasis on the
                    chaos and obstinacy.

                <h3><span>No Face Project</span></h3>
                <p> This project cemented the end of our 
                    photoshop arc. We had to use all of our 
                    photoshop skills in one final piece that
                    represented us with "no face". I decided to
                    use a wardrobe, with each shelf peering into
                    a different dimension. For example, there's a 
                    cowboy dimension with nothing but a boot and a 
                    leg, showcasing how bootleg this really was. But hey, I used
                    every technique in the book to create it, and I'm proud of 
                    the final product.
                 </p>
                 <h3><span>Artist Statement</span></h3>
                <p> I originally only took a photo of myself and the open closet of the library, so I knew I had to get
                    creative with this one. I imagined that each shelf of the closet would represent a slice of who I
                    am, so I set off to make that a reality. In the end, each shelf ended up being a portal to another
                    dimension, which I think represents the intricacies of who I am. Youâ€™ll see an octopus crawling
                    from the limitless ocean to a rural wild west with nothing but a boot and a leg in the center... To
                    bring all of these images together, the layer mask was my best friend. Specifically, I really used
                    the object and quick selection tools. I also experimented with distorting images to my liking and
                    painting light on the canvas wherever I saw fit. Finally, I added the spacial background which
                    really tells the story I was trying to convey.
